Maternal Health Analysis and Dashboard

Project Overview

This project aims to analyze maternal health trends, including morbidity, mortality, and complications, using the Maternal Ultrasound Nutrition dataset. We explore how maternal abdominal fat, measured via ultrasound, correlates with pregnancy complications such as gestational diabetes and preeclampsia. The Power BI dashboard visualizes these trends, highlighting correlations, healthcare access, and socio-economic disparities to aid better healthcare interventions.

Tools Used:

Power BI: Used for data visualization and creating interactive dashboards.

SQL: Used for data cleaning and transforming the dataset.


Dataset

Maternal Ultrasound Nutrition dataset: This dataset includes maternal health data, particularly abdominal fat measurements, and pregnancy outcomes.


Cleaning Process (SQL)

The data cleaning process included:

Removing missing or duplicate records.

Converting data types for consistency.

Handling outliers and correcting errors in the dataset.



Achievements:

Successfully built an interactive Power BI dashboard showcasing maternal health trends.

Analyzed the correlation between maternal abdominal fat and complications like gestational diabetes and preeclampsia.

Identified healthcare access and socio-economic disparities that affect maternal health outcomes.

Cleaned and transformed the data using SQL for accurate analysis.
