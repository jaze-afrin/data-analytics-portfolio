🫀 Cardiac Failure Outcome Hackathon – SQL Queries (Q33–Q48)

This file contains SQL-based solutions developed during a hackathon focused on heart failure outcomes. The dataset comprised records of 2,008 patients hospitalized with heart failure in Sichuan, China, including 168 clinical and demographic features.

The hackathon involved answering 80 analytical questions using SQL. I was responsible for questions 33 to 48, which focus on stored procedures, window functions, PLSQL blocks, custom functions, health indicators (monocyte percentage, MAP, BMI), patient demographics, and responsiveness levels.
