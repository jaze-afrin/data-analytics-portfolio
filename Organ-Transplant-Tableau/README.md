📊 Organ Transplant Analysis – Tableau Dashboard

📝 Type: Healthcare Data Project

🩺 Project Overview
This project analyzes data on organ procurement, focusing on patient demographics, obesity impacts, and transplant outcomes. By evaluating key factors affecting organ donation and matching, this dashboard aims to provide insights into Organ Procurement Organization (OPO) efficiency and strategies for improving transplant success.

📌 Key Insights
Gender and Demographic Trends: Of 128,091 patients, 58% are male, and 41% are female. 60.03% of the patients are white, with the largest group falling within the 50-60 age range.

Obesity’s Impact on Donor Eligibility: 57% of potential donors are categorized as obese. Obesity significantly reduces eligibility due to increased risks of complications during organ recovery and the effects on organ quality.

Transplant Success Rates: The highest transplantation rates occurred in patients with conditions like ICH/Stroke (23.45%), Blunt Injury (19.97%), and Cardiovascular issues (17.18%).

Organ Procurement Efficiency: OPO1 demonstrated the highest efficiency in approval, authorization, procurement, and transplantation processes.

Blood Type Impact: Positive blood types exhibited a higher transplantation rate than negative blood types.

Timing and Authorization Issues: Negative time intervals were found between procurement and recorded time of death, mainly for brain-dead patients. These values resulted from the practice of maintaining life support for organ viability until procurement.

Efficiency Analysis for Organ Procurement

🧹 Data Cleaning & Challenges
SQL Data Preparation: Transformed the dataset by converting Boolean values to numeric, handling null values, and merging relevant columns. Added time intervals between key transplant events to measure OPO efficiency.

Challenges: Addressed missing data, dealt with future date anomalies for patient de-identification, and reviewed complex data like cause of death. Negative time intervals were investigated and found to be related to brain-dead patients maintained on life support.

📝 Recommendations
Educate healthcare professionals on timely communication and organ transplantation protocols.

Ensure prompt referral of viable patients to donor hospitals for organ procurement.

Minimize delays between death and procurement through better coordination among healthcare teams.

Improve authorization processes by developing strategies to approach next of kin more effectively, especially in non-donor cases.
